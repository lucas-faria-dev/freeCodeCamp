### Reports
- how will the report be consumed? 
- is it displayed on a page like a dashboard? 
- will it need to be exported to a pdf?
- how many reports are we building?
- who has access to generate these reports?
- how often are these reports accessed?
- do we need to create a separate reporting database to decouple report queries from the operational database?
- how do we optimize performance for generating these reports?
- how dynamic the report engine should be? (if it is too dynamic, we need to push out the use case to an external tool)
